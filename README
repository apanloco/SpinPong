
OVERVIEW

Spin Pong is an fun and addictive 2-player Pong game for PS3, with some interesting physics and stereo sound.

This was coded only using a retail unit, using logging over UDP.

I used the guide from:

INSTALLATION

I built this with the 1.92 SDK on windows with msys. Just do this:
- cd <directory>
- build.bat
- you now have spinpong.pkg
- install as usual

NOTES

For homebrew developers check out:
- Log.h/Log.cpp for code to log over network.

Sounds are converted from .wav to .raw using:
for i in *.wav; do sox -V -S $i -r 48000 -e float -b 32 -c 1 -B $i.raw; done
because i was too lazy to code a wav loader.
